Since a few days I am not able to use Google Maps in Chrome. It just goes black when I open <a href="http://maps.google.co.in" target="_blank">maps</a>. 
I guess it's because I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04.

The following solution works for me though.

1. Open `chrome://flags/` in your Chrome browser
2. Enable `Disable WebGL` <br> <img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7505/15471182924_9ecf30bf5d_z.jpg">
3. Relaunch your Google Chrome

Google Maps is back in it's natural color.
