So I decide to throw a post-exam party for my cousins. As I've always wanted to try my hands at cooking Lasagna, I thought why not keep lasagna in the menu. Kids love cheese and pasta! And it turned out awesome-licious.  Here's the recipe for yummy Lasagna.

Serves 5-6 

Ingredients:

* 15 Lasagna Noodles (Cook according to packge directions)
* 2 Zucchnis - Yellow and Green each, thin sliced
* 2 Capsicums (Bell Pepper) - red and yellow each, diced
* 1 Onion, finely chopped
* 1 bowl of fresh Basil leaves, chopped
* 1 cup of Tomato and Basil Sauce
* 2 tablespoons of Olive oil
* 400gm of Mozzarella Cheese, grated
* 400gm of Cottage Cheese, grated
* Salt and Pepper to taste

Preparation:

1. Heat oil in a frying pan. Saute finely chopped onion and minced garlic. Toss in zucchnis and capcisum and saute well for few minutes. 
2. Add sauce, Basil leaves, pinch of salt, pepper and stir occasionally until softened. 
3. Greese the casserole with olive oil. Put a layer of cooked vegetables to cover the bottom. Arrange lasagna noodles. Spread cottage cheese and mozzarella cheese over the noodles. Repeat the same with the final layer of vegetables and cheese. 
4. Keep the casserole in microwave for 10 minutes. 

And... Lasagna is ready to serve!
